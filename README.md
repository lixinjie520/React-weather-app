# React Weather App

This project is a learning-oriented React application built to practice API integration, data fetching, and basic data presentation using a third-party weather API.

## Project Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to understand how frontend applications communicate with external APIs, manage environment variables, and present dynamic data in a clear user interface.

## Features
- Search weather information by city name
- Fetch weather data from a third-party API using Axios
- Display temperature and basic weather information
- Handle API response data and basic error scenarios
  
You can enter a city name in the search bar to retrieve and display the corresponding weather information.
